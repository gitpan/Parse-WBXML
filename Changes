	Support DevInf 1.1, and a test to go through the samples/wbxml/*.wbxml
	files to check whether we can extract the basic metadata (still need tests
	for XML->WBXML->XML roundtrip handling)

	SyncML 1.1 DTD support, and handle strtable lookups for character data.

0.002     2012-01-02 08:19:41 Europe/London
	Added some missing public IDs, several fixes around element and
	attribute parsing, implemented initial termstr method for terminated
	strings (incorrectly assumes \0 terminator but this is 'good enough'
	for utf8 documents).
